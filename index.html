          <h2>Evolutionary computation for machine learning</h2>
          <aside class='notes'>This is the abstract I sent:
            "The current hype cycle AI is has taken away from the collective mind the use of other techniques that help find the best intelligence for a particular problem, or help evolve solutions to machine learning or any kind of problems. In this talk we will talk about the current state of evolutionary techniques for machine learning, from the low-level implementation tricks to make them run efficiently in current computing systems, to how this can be put to use evolving the 'brains" of game players, gaming backstories or racing cars"</aside>

	    <h1>What is artificial intelligence?</h1>

	    <aside class='notes'>In those days, there were talks about
	    symbolic and subsymbolic artificial intelligence, as well
	    as different "paths": artificial life and bioinspiration,
	    fuzzy logic and, of course, neural networks. Nowadays all
	    statistical methods whose final objective is related to
	    human senses or capabilities or natural processes are
	    called artificial intelligence. But nowadays, things seem
	    to have converged.</aside>

	    <aside class='notes'>Multiply-accumulate arrays, or vectors. That's basically it. That is what TensorFlow does, and is the basis of most neural network algorithms. It's floating point arithmetic, but you can also use limited precision if you want.

          <h1>Intelligence, evolved</h1>
          <aside class='notes'>Bioinspiration is a strong force in
        modern heuristics applied to engineering. Looking at nature to find out how to solve
        problems. Yet it's not prevailing in artificial intelligence:
        concepts like learning or training are more important in that
        sense than evolving. Yet it's possible to find ways to evolve
        stuff that are simply better, more intelligent, than those
            based on simple solutions.</aside>
